Question 1:
a.) The value $3145.13 uses the mean of the order_amounts column to calculate the AOV.
The mean is not robust against outlying data, such as bulk orders or abnormally expensive shoes.
As such, outliers will skew the mean toward a value that does not make sense.
Better ways to evaluate the data would be to exclude outliers, or find the mean of a random sample of sufficiently large size. 
As well, a different metric other than mean could be used to find the average.

b.) I would report the median of the order_amount column, as it will be more robust to the outliers in this dataset than the mean.

c.) The value of the median of the order_amount column is 284.




Question 2:
a.) 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Orders
WHERE ShipperID = 1

There were 54 orders shipped by Speedy Express in total.


b.)
SELECT LastName 
FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID=(SELECT EmployeeID
			FROM Orders 
			GROUP BY EmployeeID
			ORDER BY COUNT(EmployeeID) DESC
			limit 1);


The last name of the employee with the most orders is Peacock


c.) I was unsure of the wording of this question, and figured it couldn't hurt to practice querying, so I did this question two ways:


The First Way: I found the product that was ordered the most by customers in Germany, with respect to the number of unique orders said product appears in.
For example, Gorgonzola Telino appears in 5 unique orders.


SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = (SELECT ProductID
			FROM OrderDetails
			WHERE OrderID in (SELECT OrderID
						FROM Orders
						WHERE CustomerID in (SELECT CustomerID 
										FROM Customers 
										WHERE country = "Germany"))                                   
			GROUP BY ProductID
			ORDER BY count(ProductID) DESC
			limit 1);

In this way, the product that was ordered the most by customers in Germany is Gorgonzola Telino.


The Second Way: I found the product that was ordered the most by customers in Germany, with respect to the quantity ordered of said product.

SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = (SELECT ProductID
				FROM OrderDetails
				WHERE OrderID in (SELECT OrderID
							FROM Orders
							WHERE CustomerID in (SELECT CustomerID 
											FROM Customers 
											where country = "Germany"))                                 
				GROUP BY ProductID
				ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC
				LIMIT 1);


In this way, the product that was ordered the most by customers in Germany is Boston Crab Meat.
